# Image Inpainting using Federated Learning

Image inpainting is a technique used to fill missing or corrupted regions in images. However, the traditional approaches require centralized data storage, which poses privacy concerns. To address these issues, this project presents a federated learning approach for image inpainting using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

The proposed approach trains a CNN model on client devices using a subset of their data and then aggregates the model weights on a central server to update the global model. The CNN model is specifically designed for image inpainting tasks and has shown promising results in previous studies. The federated learning approach allows for data privacy as the data remains on the client devices and is not shared with the central server.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the approach, experiments were conducted on the MNIST dataset, a widely used dataset for image classification tasks. The results showed that the proposed approach can achieve similar performance to a centralized approach while ensuring data privacy. The proposed approach also achieved faster convergence times due to the parallelization of training on client devices.

The proposed federated learning approach for image inpainting has the potential to be applied to various real-world scenarios where privacy concerns are paramount. The approach allows for the training of a high-quality model while ensuring data privacy, making it suitable for applications in healthcare and finance, where sensitive data is involved. Further research can investigate the extension of the approach to larger datasets and more complex models, leading to better results
